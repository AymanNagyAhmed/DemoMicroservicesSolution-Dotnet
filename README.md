# Dotnet 8 webapi Demo MicroService Solution


This project for educational purposes:
1. DOTNET 8 WebAPI Customer Microservice with (SQL Server, Entity Framework Core)
2. DOTNET 8 WebAPI Product Microservice with (MySQL, Entity Framework Core)
<!-- 3. DOTNET 8 WebAPI MongoDB Microservice - DOTNET Core MongoDB CRUD -->
<!-- 4. DOTNET 8 WebAPI API Gateway - Ocelot API Microservice -->

This solution is a collection of three microservices with different database (SQL Server, MySQL & MongoDB).
I used [Ocelot API Gateway](https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot) which communicates with all the three microservices for doing the CRUD operations. Finally we'll also develop a Web Application which only communicates with the API Gateway.
